set backup

## The characters treated as closing brackets when justifying paragraphs.
## This may not include any blank characters.  Only closing punctuation,
## optionally followed by these closing brackets, can end sentences.

## Set the target width for automatic hard-wrapping and for justifying
## paragraphs.  If the specified value is 0 or less, the wrapping point

# set magic

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,

## of tabs and spaces.  187 in ISO 8859-1 (0000BB in Unicode) and 183 in
## ISO-8859-1 (0000B7 in Unicode) seem to be good values for these.
## The default when in a UTF-8 locale:
set whitespace "»·"
## The default otherwise:
set whitespace ">."

## Let an unmodified Backspace or Delete erase the marked region (instead
## of a single character, and without affecting the cutbuffer).
